# Finpilot: Lean Business Plan

## 🎯 Mission & Vision

**Mission:**  
Empower individuals to confidently plan for their financial future by simulating real-life scenarios using intuitive, accurate, and affordable forecasting tools.

**Vision:**  
Become the go-to platform for personalized financial forecasting — simple enough for beginners, powerful enough for experts.

## 🧩 Problem & Solution

**Problem:**  
Most financial tools are either:

- Too generic (e.g., basic retirement calculators)
- Too complex (built for advisors)
- Too expensive for the average household

People lack an intuitive way to visualize how big life decisions (buying a house, retiring early) interact with income, assets, and savings goals.

**Solution:**  
Finpilot gives users:

- Milestone-driven forecasting (college, retirement, home, etc.)
- Simple inputs + clear visuals
- Smart insights (premium)
- A fair, low-cost pricing model
